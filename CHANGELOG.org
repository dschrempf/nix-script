* Version 3.0.0
This is the first release by myself (Dominik Schrempf) after Brian Hicks has
flagged =nix-script= unmaintained. This release does not contain any breaking
changes.

I have
- updated the Rust toolchain and dependencies;
- added many small changes affecting error and log messages, as well as code
  comments;
- renamed the internal =directives= library to =nix-script-directives=.

There is more to come!

* Version 2
According to Brian Hicks, this was a complete rewrite of version 1.
